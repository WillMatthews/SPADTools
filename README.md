Some tools to predict SiPM performance based on [Long Zhang's Thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2a18bcac-c82b-40c2-a650-b935344962a4).
My own research found some of these metrics to be accurate, but others to be less so.

These calculations were written in the first few weeks of my DPhil, and were used to springboard me towards selecting a SiPM that would give a high enough performance to obtain a world record.
Since leaving the field of Optical Wireless Communications, I no longer have any need for these predictions, so I may as well share them.
